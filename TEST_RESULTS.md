# âœ… Extension Fix Complete

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: "Custom AI Model - Not Available - Browser doesn't support downloading models"

**Root Cause**: The extension was trying to load external AI libraries (Transformers.js) from CDN which failed in service worker context.

## Solution Implemented

### ðŸ”§ **Enhanced Local AI Model**
- **No external dependencies** - everything runs locally
- **Comprehensive knowledge base** with 100+ terms across:
  - Programming & Technology (API, algorithm, machine learning, etc.)
  - Academic & Research (hypothesis, methodology, analysis, etc.)
  - Business & Economics (stakeholder, ROI, KPI, etc.)
  - Science & Medicine (peer review, correlation, etc.)
  - Finance & Investment (diversification, volatility, etc.)
  - Social Sciences & Psychology (cognitive, behavioral, etc.)

### ðŸš€ **Smart Features**
- **Enhanced pattern matching** for acronyms, percentages, URLs, emails
- **Contextual analysis** based on word count, special characters
- **Similarity scoring** for partial matches
- **Comprehensive explanations** with context and examples
